            <h2>A little about me</h2>
            <p>People always tell me that my ability to learn quickly, work hard and being personable, and be liked by everyone makes me a great employee. Indeed, I've been successful at nearly everything I've done. I am a hardworking and very determined individual. I make things happen. I am a go-getter; I am motivated by success. I loved pushing myself and learning new things! When someone says I can't do something, I will do everything I am able to, I show them that I can. I am always on time. I presume with your company, customer service is a top priority and that is what helps drive your company. In every one of my jobs, I have always tried to make people comfortable around me and help them with anything that I can. I believe having exceptional customer service skills is great quality to have and is one that companies, along with yours, really looks for. I know I would be an asset to your company. Thank you for your time and consideration.  </p>
