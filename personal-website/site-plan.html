        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        I'm gonna have a picture of me so people know what I look like. And I'm planning on having a summary about what I do on the home page. On the home page I am going to have three tabs. They will be called home, my work, and contact me. Since I have such diverse skills in technology. I will put the list of skills I have and what I can provide to the company or person or whoever is looking at my page. I will also have a quick summary that would say something like,
        </p>
        <p>
        Personable and knowledgeable IT support specialist with over 12 years of experience assisting users with various hardware, software, and network connectivity related issues. Efficient in explaining technical IT concepts and procedures to non-technical users. Love learning new skills and information every day. Not afraid to do the research needed to increase my knowledge and abilities
       </p>
        <p>
        People always tell me that my ability to learn quickly, work hard and being personable, and be liked by everyone makes me a great employee. Indeed, I've been successful at nearly everything I've done. I am a hardworking and very determined individual. I make things happen. I am a go-getter; I am motivated by success. I loved pushing myself and learning new things! When someone says I can't do something, I will do everything I am able to, I show them that I can. I am always on time.
        
        I presume with your company, customer service is a top priority and that is what helps drive your company. In every one of my jobs, I have always tried to make people comfortable around me and help them with anything that I can. I believe having exceptional customer service skills is great quality to have and is one that companies, along with yours, really looks for. I know I would be an asset to your company. Thank you for your time and consideration.

      </ul>
      <h3>My Work</h3>
      <p>
        On my work page, it will have projects people can look at. And next to each one of those projects it will have a description of what the project was what it was for and a little bit of the background up the project period. The user can also see more of the kind of work that I have done. This page will be filled with recent and older projects. I will show projects that I have done in college two projects that I have worked with a larger team with. I will also talk about in a paragraph at the top of the page about why I have such a diverse portfolio. I will explain to them that I am constantly learning and acquiring skills in all sorts of different things. And because of my diverse portfolio I can better cater to whatever the user or business needs. I will also let them know that if I am unable to helped them in a particular situation I will guide them to someone to help in the areas that I am unable to. I will also let the user know that the website they are viewing was one of my projects.

      </ul>
      <h3>Contact Me</h3>
      <p>
        On the contact page I will have a list of ways to contact me. I will have my phone number posted. I will also post my available hours that they can contact me. I will also post my LinkedIn profile link so they can see what companies I have worked for. I will also post my e-mail address. On this page I have been thinking of maybe having different clients that I have worked with in the past write a testimonial or review about me. I think by doing this, people or businesses we'll see the other people have chosen me to help them with whatever their needs were.
